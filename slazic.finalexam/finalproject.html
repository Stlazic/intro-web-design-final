                            most welcoming face we see. All year the Moon shines brightly, making our
                            cold, dark nights more bearable. For generations, we have looked
                            up at the night sky and wondered about the mysteries our sister in
                            the sky held. The Moon has a massive influence on our planet, from the
                            tides and the eclipses, to the cultural impact its had on the people on it.
                            The Moon is one of the most beautiful objects in space
                            and its right in our back door.

            <h2>Lunar New Year</h2>
            <p> Lunar New Year is the beginning of a calendar year whose months are 
                moon cycles, based on the lunar calendar or lunisolar calendar. It is
                celebrated in East Asian cultures as a result of the traditional 
                lunisolar calendar of China and while each culture follows the same
                calendar, they each have their own traditions. In Chinese traditon, each
                lunar new year is associated with an animal that is on rotation every
                twelve years. The animals are: Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, Pig, Rat, Ox, Tiger,
                Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, and Horse.

            <h2>Solar and Lunar Eclipses</h2>
            <p> There are two types of Eclipses: Lunar Eclipses and Solar
                eclipses. Both are slightly different but they are both as beautiful to look at.
            </p>

                    <td>
                        <h3>Solar Eclipses:</h3>
                        <p> Solar Eclipses happen when the Moon
                            passes between the Sun and the Earth
                            blocking sunlight for a brief period
                            of time.</p>
                        <p>
                            Since the Earth is so much bigger than the
                            Moon, the shadow usually covers a very small portion
                            of the globe. You have to be in a specific
                            part of the globe to see a solar eclipse. Solar eclipses
                            are dangerous to look at with your bare eyes because you are
                            essentially looking straight at the sun. You can still see
                            the Suns corona peeking behind the Moon and the when it moves
                            you can see the edge of the Sun.

                        <p>Lunar Eclipses happen when the Earth
                            passes between the sun and the Moon
                            casting a shadow on the Moon. This shadow
                            is usually red or orange and its very pretty
                            to look at.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Just like solar eclipses, you need to be
                            in a very specific part of the globe to see
                            it happen. As opposed to their brighter counterparts,
                            you can look at Lunar eclipses with your eyes.
                            Lunar eclipses are sometimes called Blood Moons
                            because of their unnaturally red color.
                            They are this red for the same reason that sunsets
                            are red, light is being refracted through Earths 
                            atmosphere.
