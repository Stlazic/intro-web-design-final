                       the Sun, plants couldn't photosynthesize, oxygen couldn't be
                       produced. Water wouldn't evaporate and turn into rain that

                       not be possible. Our warm ball of light keeps us alive and gives
                       us a nice place to call home. What a great Star we have to call ours.

                    <h3>Solar Eclipses:</h3>
                    <p> Solar Flares happen when large amounts of electromagnetic
                        radiation are ejected into space from the surface of the Sun.
                        Solar flares usually take place on active regions of the Sun,
                        where strong magnetic fields are present typically
                        noticable due to the dark sunspots on the star. When enough
                        EM radiation builds up it gets released in a massive, dense
                        solar flare. Solar flares can last from minutes to hours depending
                        on their intensity.

                    <h3>Solar flares and Humans:</h3>
                    <p> Thankfully, the atmosphere and Earth's magnetic field
                        protect us from any radiation and danger that these
                        flares may pose, but geomagnetic storms may occur as a
                        result of the magnetic field intercepting the flare.
                        A storm like this won't have any real impact on us on
                        the surface but it may interfere with our radio communications
                        and GPS signals worldwide. A positive consequence of a solar flare
                        hitting the Earth is the beautiful Northern lights (Aurora Borealis)
                        that happens as a result of stray particles interacting with
                        our atmospheric gases to create that gorgeous glow.
