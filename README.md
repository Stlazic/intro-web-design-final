# intro-web-design-final
This is a wiki I made as a final project for one of my classes. I focused on CSS and visual aspects of the website.
I initially created the one page about the moon but I wanted to add more and make it more in depth so I created the sun page. In hindsight I would have added a more obvious cont..
link between the moon/sun page but its not completely hidden so I dont mind it. Aesthetically I still enjoy this website but there are some fundemental design changes I would cont...
make. My JavaScript could be a little better and my HTML is incredibly messy. I was still learning CSS too at this point so I could have some things look better as well.
